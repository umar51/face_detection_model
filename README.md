# Human Face Emotions Detection with Neural Network Model
- Neural Network Model has been trained to detect human face emotions using GoogleNet architecture. 
- Whole model has been trained on Google Colaboratory with GPU runtime.
- Dataset used is fer2013 available at kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deadskull7/fer2013
- Python script utilizes the Datasets saved on google drive and also saves the trained models on Google Drive
- For testing on real time images, python script uses device's webcam to capture image.
- Each step is kept separate for simplicity and understanding.
